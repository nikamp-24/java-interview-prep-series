# final, finally, and finalize in Java

## **final**

A keyword used for: - **Variables** → makes them constant (cannot be
reassigned). - **Methods** → prevents them from being overridden. -
**Classes** → prevents them from being inherited.

## **finally**

A block in exception handling that always executes, whether an exception
is thrown or not.\
Commonly used for cleanup operations like closing files or database
connections.

## **finalize**

A method in the Object class that is called by the Garbage Collector
before an object is destroyed.\
It's rarely used today and generally discouraged because its execution
is not guaranteed.
