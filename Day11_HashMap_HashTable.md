### HashMap:
“HashMap is a part of the Java Collections Framework introduced in Java 1.2. It stores key-value pairs and allows one null key and multiple null values. It is not synchronized, so it is faster but not thread-safe.”

### Hashtable:
“Hashtable is a legacy class introduced in Java 1.0. It also stores key-value pairs but does not allow any null keys or null values. It is synchronized, meaning it is thread-safe but slower compared to HashMap.”

“The main differences are:

HashMap is faster but not thread-safe, while Hashtable is slower but thread-safe.

HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values, but Hashtable doesn’t allow nulls.

Also, HashMap is newer and part of the Collections Framework, whereas Hashtable is a legacy class.”

“If thread safety is required with better performance, we often use ConcurrentHashMap instead of Hashtable in modern Java applications.”

Sample Interview Answer

“A HashMap is a collection class introduced in Java 1.2 that stores data in key-value pairs. It’s not synchronized, so it’s faster but not thread-safe. It allows one null key and multiple null values.
On the other hand, a Hashtable is a legacy class from Java 1.0. It is synchronized, making it thread-safe, but that also makes it slower. It doesn’t allow null keys or values.
In modern applications, if I need thread safety, I prefer using ConcurrentHashMap over Hashtable.”
